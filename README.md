# PhpMVC

A simple PHP MVC framework for personal use.

### About Me

I am far from a professional developer, yet, I have been excited about coding since childhood. I am only working on this framework for my own excitement & hoping to use it as a backend prototype while working on some personal projects.

### Plans

There is no guarantee that I will keep developing this, and it is more than likely that there will never ever be a release version.

### Documentation

No documentation is currently available, and I only fill in some PHPDoc if I am in the mood.

### Dependencies & Credits to:

[WhichBrowser/Parser-PHP](https://github.com/WhichBrowser/Parser-PHP "whichbrowser/parser")

Please forgive me in advance for I might miss including credits to some projects I have benefited from.
